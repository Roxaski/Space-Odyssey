## Welcome to Space Odyssey

Ever wondered about space and everything that it encapsulates? Then wonder no further! This website was created to explore all about space and our universe, including our history with space travel and what the future potentially holds for generations to come. We explore the planets within our solar system to learn a little bit more about them, and their rotation around our sun's soldar system along with Nasa's efforts with space exploration, included within the website are images that we're officialy taken from Nasa.

## Feedback 

If anyone has any feedback i would greatly appreciate, as i'm currently learning web development and if anybody has any constructive notes for me to improve upon, that would be great! For anyone that checks it out i hope you enjoyed browsing it as much as i enjoyed building it.
